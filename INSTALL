INSTALL USING NODE.JS


BEFORE YOU START: 
  I recommend you do this as a normal user and not root.
  The official pi distro has a "coder" user that Coder runs
  under, and ports 80 and 433 are forwarded to 8080/8081.

MANUAL INSTALL:

1. You need to have node.js and npm installed
   # before you start test your nodejs and npm: 
   # test node installation using: node -v
   # test npm installation using:  npm -v 

2. Download Coder from git.
   # git clone https://github.com/Jalalhejazi/coder.git  

3. In coder-base run "npm install" to download all the
   needed modules. If this failes, then do the installation manually
   npm install using package.json as installation configuration and versions.

4. Install the basic Coder apps.
   # cd coder-apps
   # ./install_common.sh ../coder-base/

5. Edit config.js to your liking. I recommend starting
   with the settings in config.js.localhost and running
   the localhost server.

6. Start Coder
   # cd coder-base
   # node localserver.js

7. Test with Browser
   # https://localhost:8001


If you want to run Coder on an external port, you'll need
to run server.js instead of localserver.js.  This requires
a bit of port forwarding setup in iptables. Look in
the raspbian-addons directory to see the customizations that
were made to the stock raspbian distro.

The raspberry pi version of Coder has some other
tweaks that allow you to change your wifi settings
and keep your Pi password in sync with your Coder password.
There's some convoluted system configuration involved, which is
probably why you'd want to start with the Coder disk image,
but the modified apps are available by running ./install_pi.sh
after step 4. Modifications to the stock raspbian configuration
can be found in raspbian-addons.
